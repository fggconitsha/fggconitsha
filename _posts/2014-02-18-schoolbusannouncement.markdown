We are very pleased to announce that our alma mater has received the School Bus. After two years of planning and a lot of collaborative effort, our alma mater, FGGC Onitsha, has received the school bus donated by the FGGC Onitsha USA/Canada Alumni Chapter. Thank you for making it happen! 

### The Bus is Here

On November 15 2013, the school bus, purchased by the FGGC Onitsha USA/Canada Alumni Chapter, through our collective fund-raising efforts, was delivered to the school.

We cannot express to you in words the joy, excitement and gratitude of the Principal, Dr. Mrs Chinyere Nzerem, the entire staff and students of our beloved alma mater. Instead, we shall attempt to convey this in pictures:
