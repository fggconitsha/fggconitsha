Yes!! We made it! After two years of planning and a lot of collaborative effort, our alma mater, FGGC Onitsha, has received the school bus donated by the FGGC Onitsha USA/Canada Alumni Chapter.


### The Bus is Here
On November, 15 2013, the school bus, purchased by the FGGC Onitsha USA/Canada Alumni Chapter, through our collective fund-raising efforts, was delivered to the school.

We cannot express to you in words the joy, excitement and gratitude of the Principal, Dr Mrs Chinyere Nzerem, the entire staff and students of our beloved alma mater. Instead, we shall attempt to convey this in pictures:


### Shout out!
Our sincere gratitude to everyone for all your support and tireless effort to make this
possible.  

Special Acknowledgement to the following people who went above and beyond.  
- Chito Onochie (Class of '90 - USA): She made the connections   
- Bola Coker (Class of '86 - Lagos. She was our point of contact, represented us in purchase transaction and facilitated shipment to Onitsha.  
- Ijeoma Ubosi (Class of '89 - Lagos). She saved us a lot of money and wahala, helping us to get the best dollar exchange rate.  
- Winnie Okolo (Class of '84 - Onitsha). In Onitsha, she received the school bus from the shipper and facilitated delivery to school - see photo link).   

We thank you for your dedication and being instrumental in facilitating this project.

### More To Come..
We are not done yet. Our aim is continue giving and supporting FGGC Onitsha, giving back as much as we can.

Please join us in this effort. See how you can help.
